## Introduction

This notebook uses `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` to predict Formula 1 race positions based on historical data. The main steps include data preprocessing to handle missing values, model training using gradient boosting, hyperparameter tuning using `RandomizedSearchCV`, and generating predictions for submission.

## Setup

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with necessary libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- scipy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scipy
```
## Data

The dataset includes various features crucial for Formula 1 race predictions:

- **driverId**: Unique identifier for the driver
- **constructorId**: Unique identifier for the constructor (team)
- **grid**: Starting position on the grid
- **race points**: Points earned in the race
- **laps**: Number of laps completed
- **fastest lap time**: Time for the fastest lap
- **maximum speed**: Maximum speed achieved during the race
- **race details**: Additional details about the race

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values and converting data types as required to ensure compatibility with the model.

## Model Training

The `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` is employed for its robust performance in regression tasks. It is initialized with suitable parameters and trained on the preprocessed training data. Early stopping criteria based on RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) are utilized to prevent overfitting.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameters such as learning rate, max depth, min samples leaf, and L2 regularization are optimized using `RandomizedSearchCV`. This technique explores a defined search space and selects the best parameters based on negative RMSE scores from cross-validation.

## Model Evaluation

The trained model's performance is evaluated on the validation set using RMSE as the primary metric. This evaluation provides insights into the model's predictive accuracy and generalization ability.

## Submission

Predictions are generated for the test set using the optimized model and saved to a CSV file (`submission.csv`). The file is formatted according to competition or evaluation requirements for Formula 1 race position predictions.

## Conclusion

This notebook presents a comprehensive approach to predicting Formula 1 race positions using gradient boosting techniques. It emphasizes best practices in machine learning model development, from data preprocessing and model training to hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.
